# Rss to Api #
Hi, I have created an api that will allow you to convert rss to api. It filters all the rss feeds containing the word "gold". I have used Rss feed from 3 News firms

### Example Output ###:

{
    "data": {
        "posts": [
            {
                "author": "Livemint",
                "link": "https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/gold-prices-today-rise-but-still-down-sharply-from-last-week-s-highs-11669301426017.html",
                "published": 1669302891,
                "summary": "In India, gold prices had risen to  â‚¹53,200 per 10 gram last week.",
                "title": "Gold prices today rise but still down sharply from last week's highs"
            }
        ]
    }
}

PS: If you have suggestions to the code please share at amysojjalouis@gmail.com.
